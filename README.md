# Project Refer to Amplify startup tutorial

https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/react#option-1-watch-the-video-guide

## Step #1
```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

## Step #2
```
npx create-react-app react-amplified
cd react-amplified
```

## Step #3 - Initialize a new backend
```
amplify init
```

```
Enter a name for the project (react-amplified)

# All AWS services you provision for your app are grouped into an "environment"
# A common naming convention is dev, staging, and production
Enter a name for the environment (dev)

# Sometimes the CLI will prompt you to edit a file, it will use this editor to open those files.
Choose your default editor

# Amplify supports JavaScript (Web & React Native), iOS, and Android apps
Choose the type of app that you're building (javascript)

What JavaScript framework are you using (react)

Source directory path (src)

Distribution directory path (build)

Build command (npm build)

Start command (npm start)

# This is the profile you created with the `amplify configure` command in the introduction step.
Do you want to use an AWS profile
```

## Step #4 - Install Amplify libraries
```
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

## Step #5 Set up frontend
Open src/index.js and add the following code below the last import:
```
import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
import awsExports from "./aws-exports";
Amplify.configure(awsExports);
```

# Create a GraphQL API and database

## Step#6 Create a GraphQL API and database
```
amplify add api
```
Accept the default values which are highlighted below:
```
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
# GraphQL
? Provide API name:
# myapi
? Choose the default authorization type for the API:
# API Key
? Enter a description for the API key:
# demo
? After how many days from now the API key should expire:
# 7 (or your preferred expiration)
? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API:
# No
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? 
# No
? Do you want a guided schema creation? 
# Yes
? What best describes your project: 
# Single object with fields
? Do you want to edit the schema now? 
# Yes
```
## Step#7 Deploying the API
```
amplify push
```
```
? Are you sure you want to continue? Y

# You will be walked through the following questions for GraphQL code generation
? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API? Y
? Choose the code generation language target: javascript
? Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions: src/graphql/**/*.js
? Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions? Y
? Enter maximum statement depth [increase from default if your schema is deeply nested]: 2
```

To view the GraphQL API in the AppSync console at any time, run the following command: 
```
amplify console api
```

To view your entire app in the Amplify console at any time, run the following command:

```
amplify console
```

To test this out locally, you can run the mock command.
```
amplify mock api
```

# Connect frontend to API

Open src/App.js and replace it with the following code:
```
/* src/App.js */
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import Amplify, { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify'
import { createTodo } from './graphql/mutations'
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries'

import awsExports from "./aws-exports";
Amplify.configure(awsExports);

const initialState = { name: '', description: '' }

const App = () => {
  const [formState, setFormState] = useState(initialState)
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTodos()
  }, [])

  function setInput(key, value) {
    setFormState({ ...formState, [key]: value })
  }

  async function fetchTodos() {
    try {
      const todoData = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(listTodos))
      const todos = todoData.data.listTodos.items
      setTodos(todos)
    } catch (err) { console.log('error fetching todos') }
  }

  async function addTodo() {
    try {
      if (!formState.name || !formState.description) return
      const todo = { ...formState }
      setTodos([...todos, todo])
      setFormState(initialState)
      await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(createTodo, {input: todo}))
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('error creating todo:', err)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div style={styles.container}>
      <h2>Amplify Todos</h2>
      <input
        onChange={event => setInput('name', event.target.value)}
        style={styles.input}
        value={formState.name} 
        placeholder="Name"
      />
      <input
        onChange={event => setInput('description', event.target.value)}
        style={styles.input}
        value={formState.description}
        placeholder="Description"
      />
      <button style={styles.button} onClick={addTodo}>Create Todo</button>
      {
        todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <div key={todo.id ? todo.id : index} style={styles.todo}>
            <p style={styles.todoName}>{todo.name}</p>
            <p style={styles.todoDescription}>{todo.description}</p>
          </div>
        ))
      }
    </div>
  )
}

const styles = {
  container: { width: 400, margin: '0 auto', display: 'flex', flex: 1, flexDirection: 'column', justifyContent: 'center', padding: 20 },
  todo: {  marginBottom: 15 },
  input: { border: 'none', backgroundColor: '#ddd', marginBottom: 10, padding: 8, fontSize: 18 },
  todoName: { fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 'bold' },
  todoDescription: { marginBottom: 0 },
  button: { backgroundColor: 'black', color: 'white', outline: 'none', fontSize: 18, padding: '12px 0px' }
}

export default App
```

# Authentication with Amplify
The Amplify Framework uses Amazon Cognito as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery & other operations. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to add authentication to your application using Amazon Cognito and username/password login.

## Create authentication service
Here will auto create Cognito user pool for this App
```
amplify add auth

? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?  No, I am done.
```

# Create login UI
Open src/App.js and make the following changes:
## 1. Import the withAuthenticator component:
```
import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
```
## 2. Change the default export to be the withAuthenticator wrapping the main component:

```
export default withAuthenticator(App)
```


# In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
